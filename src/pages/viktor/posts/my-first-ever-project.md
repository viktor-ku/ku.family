It was year 2008, I was a 13 year old boy fascinated by the web, I would
learn HTML and CSS between the classes and messing around the code at the evenings. 

Trying to fit everything at once wasn't easy, I had to attend everything my ballet school 
wanted me to attend, as well as my dancing classes on the side. It's fair to 
say I got maybe an hour or less, because a) I had to share the same PC/notebook 
with my brother b) I wanted to play games and do silly boy things as well.

All in all, I started maybe a year prior, by the time I was 13 I felt confident in
that I would be able to create something for someone. According to the _Dunningâ€“Kruger effect curve_
I just arrived at the Peak of "Mount Stupid". 

How do you find a client when you are just 13? The social media, of course!

Having no way to receive or send money (not that I would need the latter anyway)
I've decided that it would be fair for me to receive my payment in the _"golosa"_.
"Golosa" is local currency in the [Vk.com](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VK_(service))
one of the most popular amongst pretty much everybody in my school and around me. _vk.com_
was pretty new back then, not a lot of users were even on the platform, but there were lots
of businesses groups and by using one of them to promote myself creating web pages
for _golosa_ I got my first opportunity to make a site for local Salsa studio in Mariupol, Ukraine.

I was given an image, a design, how this site is expected to look like and so my journey began.

I used Windows XP, notepad++ with light theme and lots of time. I've spent most of my holiday
week building this one page, I wanted everything to be perfect. At the end, I shipped my HTML, CSS code
and considering that I was given 50 votes of _vk.com_ for my troubles at the end I mark this job done!

### A few techincal issues I was facing at the time:

#### building your layouts with `<div>`'s was considered edgy

I knew that `<div>`'s and positioning with CSS is the future. With tables you could build your pages
really fast, however you couldn't customize it very well, CSS even back then felt very strong while
composing a page.

I have learnt how to use both however: tables and divs, although I tried to use div's as much as possible and
would only use tables if I didn't know how to do a given layout with them or if it just wouldn't work
properly in IE and firefox (I didn't know clearfix hack at the time, even if it existed).

#### rounded borders (corners)

What is nowadays achieved by the simple `border-radius` back then was something different: a rather 
useless trick in its functionality, however in the world of sites built with `<table>`'s it was quite 
impressive at the time.

It was achieved by cutting small images of corners from the original "design" and
creating a table with images of these rounded borders in places where we needed them (so
top left, top right, bottom left, bottom right) and in between them you would also cut images
of the regular border and try to `background-repeat` it or just shamlessly insert the entire
border image into the appropriate cell (so top and bottom borders and left-right borders are the same).

#### desktop only

The term smartphone was quite new, an iphone just got out, no one really knew what to do 
with it and honestly I don't think many cared.

What was, however, an important thing that many cared about is to make your site work with IE, firefox and 
whatever else is coming out. And it wasn't exactly easy.
